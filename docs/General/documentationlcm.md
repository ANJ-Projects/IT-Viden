# MSP and IT Helpdesk Documentation Lifecycle
**"MSP and IT Helpdesk Documentation Lifecycle"** is absolutely a *thing*—even if it's not always formalized under that name. What you're touching on is a very real and common challenge in managed service and internal IT environments: **striking the balance between over-documentation and under-documentation**.

### 🔄 The Documentation Lifecycle (MSP/Helpdesk Context)

Here's a distilled version of what a practical **Documentation Lifecycle** looks like in MSP and IT helpdesk operations:

1. **Identify**

   * What needs to be documented?
     → Systems, credentials, procedures, contact details, vendors, configs, backups, licenses, etc.

2. **Create**

   * Use templates where possible.
   * Keep it short and to the point (especially for techs under pressure).

3. **Review & Validate**

   * Make sure it’s technically correct and usable.
   * Avoid "rote" steps unless needed for niche or legacy stuff.

4. **Distribute / Store**

   * Centralized system: ITGlue, Hudu, Confluence, SharePoint, OneNote (for smaller ops), etc.
   * Access control: Who can read, who can write.

5. **Use & Update**

   * Docs should be referenced during tickets, onboarding, projects.
   * Revisit frequently accessed docs every 3–6 months.
   * Put version/date headers to avoid zombie info.

6. **Archive / Decommission**

   * Old client offboarded? Legacy system removed? Retire the doc.

### 🧠 Less is More

You're absolutely right:

> “Too much information can be just as bad as barely any.”

A good doc should:

* Fit on one screen where possible
* Use bullet points, not prose
* Contain:

  * **Essential data** (IP, port, login, licensing, renewal date)
  * **"Gotchas"** (e.g., "Restart service X, or the config won’t apply")
  * **Links** to deeper info if needed

### 📦 What Should Be Fully Documented?

Only stuff that:

* Is **non-obvious**
* Is **non-Googlable**
* Is **business-critical**
* Is **client-specific**

**Examples:**

* An internal LOB app written in-house in 2009
* A printer config that breaks unless SNMP is disabled
* A VPN that only works if the client ID is set to a certain string

### 📌 Tips for Effective MSP/Helpdesk Docs

* **Create "One-Pagers"** per system/client
* **Standardize naming** and tagging
* Use **screenshots** sparingly
* Add **TL;DR** sections at the top
* Don't document the **obvious** (“Click File > Save As” is insulting to any tech)
* For How-Tos, assume the reader is **IT-competent** but unfamiliar with this exact setup
