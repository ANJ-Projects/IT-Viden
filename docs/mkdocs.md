### TL;DR

* **Small‑to‑medium doc set and you’re the only maintainer?**  
  → Manual `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml` is perfectly fine.

* **Growing docs, several contributors, or you hate touching the giant YAML file?**  
  → Use **`awesome-pages` (now called `awesome‑nav`)** – it keeps the YAML tiny and lets each folder carry its own ordering rules.

Below is a pragmatic comparison and a couple of patterns teams typically settle on.

---

## 1. Manual `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`

| ✔ Pros | ✘ Cons |
|--------|--------|
| *Single source of truth* – you see the whole outline in one place. | File quickly turns into hundreds of lines; merge conflicts are common. |
| Works out‑of‑the‑box, zero third‑party dependencies. | Every new/renamed page means editing the YAML. |
| Absolute control: you can list files in any order, mix external links, etc. | Contributors need to understand YAML syntax and the repo layout. |

For **10–30 pages** it’s still comfortable, but once the tree grows it becomes a maintenance choke‑point.

## 2. `awesome-pages` / `awesome‑nav` plugin

> The plugin replaces or completes the `nav:` section by reading directory trees and tiny per‑folder *.pages* files. citeturn6search1

### How it feels

* You **delete the huge `nav:` block** (or keep a skeleton with the `...` placeholder) and enable the plugin:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - search      # you already have this
    - awesome-pages   # pip install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
  ```

* Inside any folder you drop a `.pages` file to tweak title, order, or hide items:

  ```yaml
  # docs/api/.pages
  title: API Reference
  sort: natural
  arrange:
    - overview.md
    - ...
    - changelog.md
  ```

* New `.md` files appear automatically in the nav with the right sort‑order. No touching `mkdocs.yml`.

### Strengths

| ✔ Pros | ✘ Cons |
|--------|--------|
| **Local decisions** – order and titles live next to the pages they affect. | Adds a plugin dependency (but it’s actively maintained – v3.1.1 released 6 Apr 2025). citeturn6search2 |
| Scales painlessly to hundreds of pages; almost zero merge conflicts. | You still need *some* YAML if you want cross‑section mixes, but you can combine manual and automatic with `...`. |
| Non‑tech writers can reorder pages by editing a two‑line `.pages` file. | If you require a nav radically different from the folder layout, manual YAML may still be clearer. |

The plugin is extremely popular in the MkDocs community (≈550 GitHub stars and bundled in many Docker images). citeturn6search0turn6search3

## 3. A hybrid many teams land on

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
site_name: My Docs
plugins:
  - search
  - awesome-pages

nav:
  - Home: index.md      # explicit top‑level entries you really care about
  - ...
```

*Everything* under `...` is generated by the plugin, but you retain total control over the handful of top‑level items.

## 4. Alternative “nav helpers”

| Plugin | Idea | When useful |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **`literate-nav`** | Define nav in a Markdown list instead of YAML. | When you prefer writing lists in MD. citeturn0search9 |
| **`mkdocs-simple-plugin`** | Similar to awesome‑pages but with different syntax. | Light projects where you want zero hidden files. citeturn4search1 |

They solve the same pain point; awesome‑pages is simply the most battle‑tested.

---

## Recommendation for *“I want it simple but with good nav”*

1. **Install `awesome-pages`/`awesome‑nav`.**  
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
   ```
2. **Start with an empty or skeletal `nav:`** (keep only the items that must stay on top).  
3. **Use `.pages` files** inside folders for ordering and friendly titles.  
4. Keep your existing `search` plugin – it works unchanged.

You’ll spend far less time in the central YAML, and contributors can curate their section without stepping on each other’s toes.
